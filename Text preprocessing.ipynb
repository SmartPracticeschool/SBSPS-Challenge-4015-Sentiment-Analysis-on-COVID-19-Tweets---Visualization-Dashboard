The command is designed to work  without\r\n       user interaction.\r\n\r\n       curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authen-\r\n       tication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file  trans-\r\n       fer  resume,  Metalink,  and more. As you will see below, the number of\r\n       features will make your head spin!\r\n\r\n       curl is powered by  libcurl  for  all  transfer-related  features.  See\r\n       libcurl(3) for details.\r\n\r\nURL\r\n       The  URL  syntax is protocol-dependent. You'll find a detailed descrip-\r\n       tion in RFC 3986.\r\n\r\n       You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs  by  writing  part  sets\r\n       within braces as in:\r\n\r\n         http://site.{one,two,three}.com\r\n\r\n       or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:\r\n\r\n         ftp://ftp.example.com/file[1-100].txt\r\n\r\n         ftp://ftp.example.com/file[001-100].txt    (with leading zeros)\r\n\r\n         ftp://ftp.example.com/file[a-z].txt\r\n\r\n       Nested  sequences  are not supported, but you can use several ones next\r\n       to each other:\r\n\r\n         http://example.com/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html\r\n\r\n       You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line.  They  will  be\r\n       fetched  in a sequential manner in the specified order. You can specify\r\n       command line options and URLs mixed and in any  order  on  the  command\r\n       line.\r\n\r\n       You  can  specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number\r\n       or letter:\r\n\r\n         http://example.com/file[1-100:10].txt\r\n\r\n         http://example.com/file[a-z:2].txt\r\n\r\n       When using [] or {} sequences when invoked from a command line  prompt,\r\n       you probably have to put the full URL within double quotes to avoid the\r\n       shell from interfering with it. This also  goes  for  other  characters\r\n       treated special, like for example '&', '?' and '*'.\r\n\r\n       Provide  the IPv6 zone index in the URL with an escaped percentage sign\r\n       and the interface name. Like in\r\n\r\n         http://[fe80::3%25eth0]/\r\n\r\n       If you specify URL without protocol:// prefix,  curl  will  attempt  to\r\n       guess  what  protocol  you might want. It will then default to HTTP but\r\n       try other protocols based on often-used host name prefixes.  For  exam-\r\n       ple,  for  host names starting with \"ftp.\" curl will assume you want to\r\n       speak FTP.\r\n\r\n       curl will do its best to use what you pass to it as a URL.  It  is  not\r\n       trying  to  validate it as a syntactically correct URL by any means but\r\n       is instead very liberal with what it accepts.\r\n\r\n       curl will attempt to re-use connections for multiple file transfers, so\r\n       that  getting many files from the same server will not do multiple con-\r\n       nects / handshakes. This improves speed. Of course this is only done on\r\n       files  specified  on  a  single command line and cannot be used between\r\n       separate curl invokes.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS METER\r\n       curl normally displays a progress meter during  operations,  indicating\r\n       the  amount  of  transferred  data,  transfer speeds and estimated time\r\n       left, etc. The progress meter displays number of bytes and  the  speeds\r\n       are  in  bytes per second. The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based.\r\n       For example 1k is 1024 bytes. 1M is 1048576 bytes.\r\n\r\n       curl displays this data to the terminal by default, so  if  you  invoke\r\n       curl  to do an operation and it is about to write data to the terminal,\r\n       it disables the progress meter as otherwise it would mess up the output\r\n       mixing progress meter and response data.\r\n\r\n       If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you need to\r\n       redirect the response output to a file, using shell redirect  (>),  -o,\r\n       --output or similar.\r\n\r\n       It  is not the same case for FTP upload as that operation does not spit\r\n       out any response data to the terminal.\r\n\r\n       If you prefer a progress  \"bar\"  instead  of  the  regular  meter,  -#,\r\n       --progress-bar  is your friend. You can also disable the progress meter\r\n       completely with the -s, --silent option.\r\n\r\nOPTIONS\r\n       Options start with one or two dashes. Many of the  options  require  an\r\n       additional value next to them.\r\n\r\n       The  short  \"single-dash\"  form  of the options, -d for example, may be\r\n       used with or without a space between it and its value, although a space\r\n       is a recommended separator. The long \"double-dash\" form, -d, --data for\r\n       example, requires a space between it and its value.\r\n\r\n       Short version options that don't need any additional values can be used\r\n       immediately  next  to  each other, like for example you can specify all\r\n       the options -O, -L and -v at once as -OLv.\r\n\r\n       In general, all boolean options are enabled with --option and yet again\r\n       disabled  with --no-option. That is, you use the exact same option name\r\n       but prefix it with \"no-\". However, in this list we mostly only list and\r\n       show  the --option version of them. (This concept with --no options was\r\n       added in 7.19.0. Previously most options were  toggled  on/off  on  re-\r\n       peated use of the same command line option.)\r\n\r\n       --abstract-unix-socket <path>\r\n              (HTTP)  Connect  through an abstract Unix domain socket, instead\r\n              of using the network.  Note: netstat shows the path  of  an  ab-\r\n              stract  socket  prefixed  with  '@', however the <path> argument\r\n              should not have this leading character.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.53.0.\r\n\r\n       --alt-svc <file name>\r\n              (HTTPS) WARNING: this option is experimental. Do not use in pro-\r\n              duction.\r\n\r\n              This option enables the alt-svc parser in curl. If the file name\r\n              points to an existing alt-svc cache file, that will be used. Af-\r\n              ter  a  completed  transfer, the cache will be saved to the file\r\n              name again if it has been modified.\r\n\r\n              Specify a \"\" file name (zero length) to avoid loading/saving and\r\n              make curl just handle the cache in memory.\r\n\r\n              If  this  option  is used several times, curl will load contents\r\n              from all the files but the last one will be used for saving.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.64.1.\r\n\r\n       --anyauth\r\n              (HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by itself,\r\n              and  use  the most secure one the remote site claims to support.\r\n              This is done by first doing a request and checking the response-\r\n              headers,  thus  possibly  inducing  an extra network round-trip.\r\n              This is  used  instead  of  setting  a  specific  authentication\r\n              method,  which  you  can  do with --basic, --digest, --ntlm, and\r\n              --negotiate.\r\n\r\n              Using --anyauth is not recommended if you do uploads from stdin,\r\n              since  it  may require data to be sent twice and then the client\r\n              must be able to rewind. If the need should arise when  uploading\r\n              from stdin, the upload operation will fail.\r\n\r\n              Used together with -u, --user.\r\n\r\n              See also --proxy-anyauth and --basic and --digest.\r\n\r\n       -a, --append\r\n              (FTP SFTP) When used in an upload, this makes curl append to the\r\n              target file instead  of  overwriting  it.  If  the  remote  file\r\n              doesn't  exist,  it will be created.  Note that this flag is ig-\r\n              nored by some SFTP servers (including OpenSSH).\r\n\r\n       --basic\r\n              (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication with the  re-\r\n              mote host. This is the default and this option is usually point-\r\n              less, unless you use it to override a previously set option that\r\n              sets  a  different  authentication method (such as --ntlm, --di-\r\n              gest, or --negotiate).\r\n\r\n              Used together with -u, --user.\r\n\r\n              See also --proxy-basic.\r\n\r\n       --cacert <file>\r\n              (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to verify\r\n              the  peer.  The  file  may contain multiple CA certificates. The\r\n              certificate(s) must be in PEM format. Normally curl is built  to\r\n              use a default file for this, so this option is typically used to\r\n              alter that default file.\r\n\r\n              curl recognizes the environment variable named  'CURL_CA_BUNDLE'\r\n              if  it  is  set,  and uses the given path as a path to a CA cert\r\n              bundle. This option overrides that variable.\r\n\r\n              The windows version of curl will automatically  look  for  a  CA\r\n              certs file named 'curl-ca-bundle.crt', either in the same direc-\r\n              tory as curl.exe, or in the Current Working Directory, or in any\r\n              folder along your PATH.\r\n\r\n              If  curl  is  built  against  the  NSS  SSL library, the NSS PEM\r\n              PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) needs to be available for this op-\r\n              tion to work properly.\r\n\r\n              (iOS  and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure Transport,\r\n              then this option is supported for  backward  compatibility  with\r\n              other  SSL  engines,  but it should not be set. If the option is\r\n              not set, then curl will use the certificates in the  system  and\r\n              user  Keychain to verify the peer, which is the preferred method\r\n              of verifying the peer's certificate chain.\r\n\r\n              (Schannel only) This option is supported for Schannel in Windows\r\n              7  or later with libcurl 7.60 or later. This option is supported\r\n              for backward compatibility with other SSL engines; instead it is\r\n              recommended  to use Windows' store of root certificates (the de-\r\n              fault for Schannel).\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       --capath <dir>\r\n              (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate  directory  to\r\n              verify  the  peer.  Multiple paths can be provided by separating\r\n              them with \":\" (e.g.  \"path1:path2:path3\"). The certificates must\r\n              be  in PEM format, and if curl is built against OpenSSL, the di-\r\n              rectory must have been processed using the c_rehash utility sup-\r\n              plied  with  OpenSSL.  Using  --capath can allow OpenSSL-powered\r\n              curl to make SSL-connections much more  efficiently  than  using\r\n              --cacert if the --cacert file contains many CA certificates.\r\n\r\n              If this option is set, the default capath value will be ignored,\r\n              and if it is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       --cert-status\r\n              (TLS) Tells curl to verify the status of the server  certificate\r\n              by using the Certificate Status Request (aka. OCSP stapling) TLS\r\n              extension.\r\n\r\n              If this option is enabled and the server sends an invalid  (e.g.\r\n              expired) response, if the response suggests that the server cer-\r\n              tificate has been revoked, or no response at  all  is  received,\r\n              the verification fails.\r\n\r\n              This  is  currently  only implemented in the OpenSSL, GnuTLS and\r\n              NSS backends.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.41.0.\r\n\r\n       --cert-type <type>\r\n              (TLS) Tells curl what type the provided  client  certificate  is\r\n              using. PEM, DER, ENG and P12 are recognized types.  If not spec-\r\n              ified, PEM is assumed.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n              See also -E, --cert and --key and --key-type.\r\n\r\n       -E, --cert <certificate[:password]>\r\n              (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified  client  certificate  file\r\n              when getting a file with HTTPS, FTPS or another SSL-based proto-\r\n              col. The certificate must be in PKCS#12 format if  using  Secure\r\n              Transport,  or PEM format if using any other engine.  If the op-\r\n              tional password isn't specified, it will be queried for  on  the\r\n              terminal.  Note  that  this  option assumes a \"certificate\" file\r\n              that is the private key and the client certificate concatenated!\r\n              See -E, --cert and --key to specify them independently.\r\n\r\n              If  curl  is  built against the NSS SSL library then this option\r\n              can tell curl the nickname of the certificate to use within  the\r\n              NSS  database defined by the environment variable SSL_DIR (or by\r\n              default /etc/pki/nssdb). If the NSS  PEM  PKCS#11  module  (lib-\r\n              nsspem.so)  is  available  then  PEM files may be loaded. If you\r\n              want to use a file from the current directory, please precede it\r\n              with  \"./\"  prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.\r\n              If the nickname contains \":\", it needs to be preceded by \"\\\"  so\r\n              that  it  is not recognized as password delimiter.  If the nick-\r\n              name contains \"\\\", it needs to be escaped as \"\\\\\" so that it  is\r\n              not recognized as an escape character.\r\n\r\n              If  curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine pkcs11\r\n              is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be used to spec-\r\n              ify  a  certificate located in a PKCS#11 device. A string begin-\r\n              ning with \"pkcs11:\" will be interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI.  If  a\r\n              PKCS#11 URI is provided, then the --engine option will be set as\r\n              \"pkcs11\" if none was provided and the --cert-type option will be\r\n              set as \"ENG\" if none was provided.\r\n\r\n              (iOS  and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure Transport,\r\n              then the certificate string can either be the name of a certifi-\r\n              cate/private  key in the system or user keychain, or the path to\r\n              a PKCS#12-encoded certificate and private key. If  you  want  to\r\n              use  a  file  from the current directory, please precede it with\r\n              \"./\" prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.\r\n\r\n              (Schannel only) Client certificates must be specified by a  path\r\n              expression  to  a  certificate  store.  (Loading PFX is not sup-\r\n              ported; you can import it to a store first). You can use \"<store\r\n              location>\\<store  name>\\<thumbprint>\"  to refer to a certificate\r\n              in  the  system  certificates  store,  for   example,   \"Curren-\r\n              tUser\\MY\\934a7ac6f8a5d579285a74fa61e19f23ddfe8d7a\".   Thumbprint\r\n              is usually a SHA-1 hex string which you can see  in  certificate\r\n              details.  Following  store locations are supported: CurrentUser,\r\n              LocalMachine, CurrentService, Services,  CurrentUserGroupPolicy,\r\n              LocalMachineGroupPolicy, LocalMachineEnterprise.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n              See also --cert-type and --key and --key-type.\r\n\r\n       --ciphers <list of ciphers>\r\n              (TLS) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection. The list\r\n              of ciphers must specify valid ciphers. Read  up  on  SSL  cipher\r\n              list details on this URL:\r\n\r\n               https://curl.haxx.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       --compressed-ssh\r\n              (SCP SFTP) Enables built-in SSH compression.  This is a request,\r\n              not an order; the server may or may not do it.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.56.0.\r\n\r\n       --compressed\r\n              (HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the algorithms\r\n              curl  supports, and save the uncompressed document.  If this op-\r\n              tion is used and the server sends an unsupported encoding,  curl\r\n              will report an error.\r\n\r\n       -K, --config <file>\r\n\r\n              Specify  a  text  file  to read curl arguments from. The command\r\n              line arguments found in the text file will be used  as  if  they\r\n              were provided on the command line.\r\n\r\n              Options  and their parameters must be specified on the same line\r\n              in the file, separated by whitespace, colon, or the equals sign.\r\n              Long  option  names  can  optionally be given in the config file\r\n              without the initial double dashes and if so, the colon or equals\r\n              characters can be used as separators. If the option is specified\r\n              with one or two dashes, there can be no colon or equals  charac-\r\n              ter between the option and its parameter.\r\n\r\n              If  the  parameter  contains whitespace (or starts with : or =),\r\n              the parameter must be  enclosed  within  quotes.  Within  double\r\n              quotes,  the  following  escape sequences are available: \\\\, \\\",\r\n              \\t, \\n, \\r and \\v. A backslash preceding any other letter is ig-\r\n              nored.  If the first column of a config line is a '#' character,\r\n              the rest of the line will be treated as a  comment.  Only  write\r\n              one option per physical line in the config file.\r\n\r\n              Specify  the  filename  to -K, --config as '-' to make curl read\r\n              the file from stdin.\r\n\r\n              Note that to be able to specify a URL in the  config  file,  you\r\n              need  to  specify  it  using the --url option, and not by simply\r\n              writing the URL on its own line. So, it could  look  similar  to\r\n              this:\r\n\r\n              url = \"https://curl.haxx.se/docs/\"\r\n\r\n              When  curl  is invoked, it (unless -q, --disable is used) checks\r\n              for a default config file and uses it if found. The default con-\r\n              fig file is checked for in the following places in this order:\r\n\r\n              1)  curl  tries  to find the \"home dir\": It first checks for the\r\n              CURL_HOME and then the HOME environment variables. Failing that,\r\n              it  uses getpwuid() on Unix-like systems (which returns the home\r\n              dir given the current user in your system). On Windows, it  then\r\n              checks for the APPDATA variable, or as a last resort the '%USER-\r\n              PROFILE%\\Application Data'.\r\n\r\n              2) On windows, if there is no .curlrc file in the home  dir,  it\r\n              checks for one in the same dir the curl executable is placed. On\r\n              Unix-like systems, it will simply try to load .curlrc  from  the\r\n              determined home dir.\r\n\r\n              # --- Example file ---\r\n              # this is a comment\r\n              url = \"example.com\"\r\n              output = \"curlhere.html\"\r\n              user-agent = \"superagent/1.0\"\r\n\r\n              # and fetch another URL too\r\n              url = \"example.com/docs/manpage.html\"\r\n              -O\r\n              referer = \"http://nowhereatall.example.com/\"\r\n              # --- End of example file ---\r\n\r\n              This  option  can be used multiple times to load multiple config\r\n              files.\r\n\r\n       --connect-timeout <seconds>\r\n              Maximum time in seconds that  you  allow  curl's  connection  to\r\n              take.   This  only  limits the connection phase, so if curl con-\r\n              nects within the given period it will continue - if not it  will\r\n              exit.  Since version 7.32.0, this option accepts decimal values.\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n              See also -m, --max-time.\r\n\r\n       --connect-to <HOST1:PORT1:HOST2:PORT2>\r\n\r\n              For  a  request  to  the  given  HOST1:PORT1  pair,  connect  to\r\n              HOST2:PORT2 instead.  This option is suitable to direct requests\r\n              at a specific server, e.g. at a specific cluster node in a clus-\r\n              ter of servers. This option is only used to establish  the  net-\r\n              work  connection.  It  does NOT affect the hostname/port that is\r\n              used for TLS/SSL (e.g. SNI, certificate verification) or for the\r\n              application  protocols.  \"HOST1\"  and  \"PORT1\"  may be the empty\r\n              string, meaning \"any host/port\". \"HOST2\" and \"PORT2\" may also be\r\n              the   empty   string,   meaning   \"use  the  request's  original\r\n              host/port\".\r\n\r\n              A \"host\" specified to this option is compared as a string, so it\r\n              needs  to  match  the name used in request URL. It can be either\r\n              numerical such as \"127.0.0.1\" or the full host name such as \"ex-\r\n              ample.org\".\r\n\r\n              This option can be used many times to add many connect rules.\r\n\r\n              See also --resolve and -H, --header. Added in 7.49.0.\r\n\r\n       -C, --continue-at <offset>\r\n              Continue/Resume  a  previous  file transfer at the given offset.\r\n              The given offset is the exact  number  of  bytes  that  will  be\r\n              skipped,  counting  from the beginning of the source file before\r\n              it is transferred to the destination.  If used with uploads, the\r\n              FTP server command SIZE will not be used by curl.\r\n\r\n              Use  \"-C  -\" to tell curl to automatically find out where/how to\r\n              resume the transfer. It then uses the given  output/input  files\r\n              to figure that out.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n              See also -r, --range.\r\n\r\n       -c, --cookie-jar <filename>\r\n              (HTTP)  Specify to which file you want curl to write all cookies\r\n              after a completed operation. Curl writes all  cookies  from  its\r\n              in-memory  cookie storage to the given file at the end of opera-\r\n              tions. If no cookies are known, no data  will  be  written.  The\r\n              file  will  be written using the Netscape cookie file format. If\r\n              you set the file name to a single dash, \"-\", the cookies will be\r\n              written to stdout.\r\n\r\n              This  command  line  option will activate the cookie engine that\r\n              makes curl record and use cookies. Another way to activate it is\r\n              to use the -b, --cookie option.\r\n\r\n              If the cookie jar can't be created or written to, the whole curl\r\n              operation won't fail or even report an error clearly. Using  -v,\r\n              --verbose  will  get  a  warning displayed, but that is the only\r\n              visible feedback you get about this possibly lethal situation.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the  last  specified  file\r\n              name will be used.\r\n\r\n       -b, --cookie <data|filename>\r\n              (HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server in the Cookie header. It\r\n              is supposedly the data previously received from the server in  a\r\n              \"Set-Cookie:\"   line.    The   data  should  be  in  the  format\r\n              \"NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2\".\r\n\r\n              If no '=' symbol is used in the argument, it is instead  treated\r\n              as a filename to read previously stored cookie from. This option\r\n              also activates the cookie engine which will make curl record in-\r\n              coming  cookies, which may be handy if you're using this in com-\r\n              bination with the -L,  --location  option  or  do  multiple  URL\r\n              transfers  on the same invoke. If the file name is exactly a mi-\r\n              nus (\"-\"), curl will instead the contents from stdin.\r\n\r\n              The file format of the file to read cookies from should be plain\r\n              HTTP  headers  (Set-Cookie style) or the Netscape/Mozilla cookie\r\n              file format.\r\n\r\n              The file specified with -b, --cookie is only used as  input.  No\r\n              cookies  will  be written to the file. To store cookies, use the\r\n              -c, --cookie-jar option.\r\n\r\n              Exercise caution if you  are  using  this  option  and  multiple\r\n              transfers may occur.  If you use the NAME1=VALUE1; format, or in\r\n              a file use the Set-Cookie format and  don't  specify  a  domain,\r\n              then the cookie is sent for any domain (even after redirects are\r\n              followed) and cannot be modified by a server-set cookie. If  the\r\n              cookie  engine is enabled and a server sets a cookie of the same\r\n              name then both will be sent on a future transfer to that server,\r\n              likely not what you intended.  To address these issues set a do-\r\n              main in Set-Cookie (doing that will include sub domains) or  use\r\n              the Netscape format.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n              Users very often want to both read cookies from a file and write\r\n              updated cookies back to a file, so using both -b,  --cookie  and\r\n              -c, --cookie-jar in the same command line is common.\r\n\r\n       --create-dirs\r\n              When used in conjunction with the -o, --output option, curl will\r\n              create the necessary local directory hierarchy as  needed.  This\r\n              option  creates the dirs mentioned with the -o, --output option,\r\n              nothing else. If the --output file name uses no dir  or  if  the\r\n              dirs it mentions already exist, no dir will be created.\r\n\r\n              Created dirs are made with mode 0750 on unix style file systems.\r\n              To  create remote directories when using FTP or SFTP, try --ftp-\r\n              create-dirs.\r\n\r\n       --crlf (FTP SMTP)  Convert  LF  to  CRLF  in  upload.  Useful  for  MVS\r\n              (OS/390).\r\n\r\n              (SMTP added in 7.40.0)\r\n\r\n       --crlfile <file>\r\n              (TLS) Provide a file using PEM format with a Certificate Revoca-\r\n              tion List that may specify peer certificates that are to be con-\r\n              sidered revoked.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.19.7.\r\n\r\n       --data-ascii <data>\r\n              (HTTP) This is just an alias for -d, --data.\r\n\r\n       --data-binary <data>\r\n              (HTTP)  This  posts data exactly as specified with no extra pro-\r\n              cessing whatsoever.\r\n\r\n              If you start the data with the letter @, the rest  should  be  a\r\n              filename.   Data  is  posted  in  a similar manner as -d, --data\r\n              does, except that newlines and carriage  returns  are  preserved\r\n              and conversions are never done.\r\n\r\n              Like  -d,  --data the default content-type sent to the server is\r\n              application/x-www-form-urlencoded. If you want the  data  to  be\r\n              treated as arbitrary binary data by the server then set the con-\r\n              tent-type to octet-stream: -H \"Content-Type:  application/octet-\r\n              stream\".\r\n\r\n              If  this  option  is  used several times, the ones following the\r\n              first will append data as described in -d, --data.\r\n\r\n       --data-raw <data>\r\n              (HTTP) This posts data similarly to -d, --data but  without  the\r\n              special interpretation of the @ character.\r\n\r\n              See also -d, --data. Added in 7.43.0.\r\n\r\n       --data-urlencode <data>\r\n              (HTTP)  This posts data, similar to the other -d, --data options\r\n              with the exception that this performs URL-encoding.\r\n\r\n              To be CGI-compliant, the <data> part should begin  with  a  name\r\n              followed  by a separator and a content specification. The <data>\r\n              part can be passed to curl using one of the following syntaxes:\r\n\r\n              content\r\n                     This will make curl URL-encode the content and pass  that\r\n                     on.  Just  be careful so that the content doesn't contain\r\n                     any = or @ symbols, as that will  then  make  the  syntax\r\n                     match one of the other cases below!\r\n\r\n              =content\r\n                     This  will make curl URL-encode the content and pass that\r\n                     on. The preceding = symbol is not included in the data.\r\n\r\n              name=content\r\n                     This will make curl URL-encode the content part and  pass\r\n                     that  on.  Note that the name part is expected to be URL-\r\n                     encoded already.\r\n\r\n              @filename\r\n                     This will make curl load data from the  given  file  (in-\r\n                     cluding  any  newlines), URL-encode that data and pass it\r\n                     on in the POST.\r\n\r\n              name@filename\r\n                     This will make curl load data from the  given  file  (in-\r\n                     cluding  any  newlines), URL-encode that data and pass it\r\n                     on in the POST. The name part  gets  an  equal  sign  ap-\r\n                     pended,  resulting  in name=urlencoded-file-content. Note\r\n                     that the name is expected to be URL-encoded already.\r\n       See also -d, --data and --data-raw. Added in 7.18.0.\r\n\r\n       -d, --data <data>\r\n              (HTTP) Sends the specified data in a POST request  to  the  HTTP\r\n              server,  in  the  same  way  that a browser does when a user has\r\n              filled in an HTML form and presses the submit button. This  will\r\n              cause curl to pass the data to the server using the content-type\r\n              application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  Compare to -F, --form.\r\n\r\n              --data-raw is almost the same but does not have a special inter-\r\n              pretation  of  the  @ character. To post data purely binary, you\r\n              should instead use the --data-binary option.  To URL-encode  the\r\n              value of a form field you may use --data-urlencode.\r\n\r\n              If  any of these options is used more than once on the same com-\r\n              mand line, the data pieces specified  will  be  merged  together\r\n              with  a  separating  &-symbol.  Thus,  using  '-d name=daniel -d\r\n              skill=lousy'  would  generate  a  post  chunk  that  looks  like\r\n              'name=daniel&skill=lousy'.\r\n\r\n              If  you  start  the data with the letter @, the rest should be a\r\n              file name to read the data from, or - if you want curl  to  read\r\n              the  data  from  stdin.  Posting data from a file named 'foobar'\r\n              would thus be done with -d, --data @foobar. When -d,  --data  is\r\n              told  to  read  from a file like that, carriage returns and new-\r\n              lines will be stripped out. If you don't want the @ character to\r\n              have a special interpretation use --data-raw instead.\r\n\r\n              See also --data-binary and --data-urlencode and --data-raw. This\r\n              option overrides -F, --form and -I,  --head  and  -T,  --upload-\r\n              file.\r\n\r\n       --delegation <LEVEL>\r\n              (GSS/kerberos)  Set  LEVEL to tell the server what it is allowed\r\n              to delegate when it comes to user credentials.\r\n\r\n              none   Don't allow any delegation.\r\n\r\n              policy Delegates if and only if the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag  is  set\r\n                     in  the  Kerberos  service  ticket,  which is a matter of\r\n                     realm policy.\r\n\r\n              always Unconditionally allow the server to delegate.\r\n\r\n       --digest\r\n              (HTTP) Enables HTTP Digest authentication. This is an  authenti-\r\n              cation  scheme  that  prevents the password from being sent over\r\n              the wire in clear text. Use this in combination with the  normal\r\n              -u, --user option to set user name and password.\r\n\r\n              If  this  option  is  used  several times, only the first one is\r\n              used.\r\n\r\n              See also -u, --user and --proxy-digest and --anyauth.  This  op-\r\n              tion overrides --basic and --ntlm and --negotiate.\r\n\r\n       --disable-eprt\r\n              (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT commands\r\n              when doing active FTP transfers. Curl will normally always first\r\n              attempt  to use EPRT, then LPRT before using PORT, but with this\r\n              option, it will use PORT right away. EPRT and  LPRT  are  exten-\r\n              sions  to  the  original  FTP  protocol, and may not work on all\r\n              servers, but they enable more functionality in a better way than\r\n              the traditional PORT command.\r\n\r\n              --eprt can be used to explicitly enable EPRT again and --no-eprt\r\n              is an alias for --disable-eprt.\r\n\r\n              If the server is accessed using IPv6, this option will  have  no\r\n              effect as EPRT is necessary then.\r\n\r\n              Disabling  EPRT only changes the active behavior. If you want to\r\n              switch to passive mode you need to not  use  -P,  --ftp-port  or\r\n              force it with --ftp-pasv.\r\n\r\n       --disable-epsv\r\n              (FTP)  (FTP)  Tell  curl  to disable the use of the EPSV command\r\n              when doing passive FTP  transfers.  Curl  will  normally  always\r\n              first  attempt to use EPSV before PASV, but with this option, it\r\n              will not try using EPSV.\r\n\r\n              --epsv can be used to explicitly enable EPSV again and --no-epsv\r\n              is an alias for --disable-epsv.\r\n\r\n              If  the  server is an IPv6 host, this option will have no effect\r\n              as EPSV is necessary then.\r\n\r\n              Disabling EPSV only changes the passive behavior. If you want to\r\n              switch to active mode you need to use -P, --ftp-port.\r\n\r\n       -q, --disable\r\n              If  used  as the first parameter on the command line, the curlrc\r\n              config file will not be read and used. See the -K, --config  for\r\n              details on the default config file search path.\r\n\r\n       --disallow-username-in-url\r\n              (HTTP)  This  tells  curl  to  exit if passed a url containing a\r\n              username.\r\n\r\n              See also --proto. Added in 7.61.0.\r\n\r\n       --dns-interface <interface>\r\n              (DNS) Tell curl to send outgoing DNS  requests  through  <inter-\r\n              face>.  This  option is a counterpart to --interface (which does\r\n              not affect DNS). The supplied string must be an  interface  name\r\n              (not an address).\r\n\r\n              See  also  --dns-ipv4-addr  and --dns-ipv6-addr. --dns-interface\r\n              requires that the underlying libcurl was  built  to  support  c-\r\n              ares. Added in 7.33.0.\r\n\r\n       --dns-ipv4-addr <address>\r\n              (DNS) Tell curl to bind to <ip-address> when making IPv4 DNS re-\r\n              quests, so that the DNS requests originate  from  this  address.\r\n              The argument should be a single IPv4 address.\r\n\r\n              See  also  --dns-interface  and --dns-ipv6-addr. --dns-ipv4-addr\r\n              requires that the underlying libcurl was  built  to  support  c-\r\n              ares. Added in 7.33.0.\r\n\r\n       --dns-ipv6-addr <address>\r\n              (DNS) Tell curl to bind to <ip-address> when making IPv6 DNS re-\r\n              quests, so that the DNS requests originate  from  this  address.\r\n              The argument should be a single IPv6 address.\r\n\r\n              See  also  --dns-interface  and --dns-ipv4-addr. --dns-ipv6-addr\r\n              requires that the underlying libcurl was  built  to  support  c-\r\n              ares. Added in 7.33.0.\r\n\r\n       --dns-servers <addresses>\r\n              Set the list of DNS servers to be used instead of the system de-\r\n              fault.  The list of IP addresses should be separated  with  com-\r\n              mas. Port numbers may also optionally be given as :<port-number>\r\n              after each IP address.\r\n\r\n              --dns-servers requires that the underlying libcurl was built  to\r\n              support c-ares. Added in 7.33.0.\r\n\r\n       --doh-url <URL>\r\n              (all)  Specifies which DNS-over-HTTPS (DOH) server to use to re-\r\n              solve hostnames, instead of  using  the  default  name  resolver\r\n              mechanism. The URL must be HTTPS.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.62.0.\r\n\r\n       -D, --dump-header <filename>\r\n              (HTTP  FTP) Write the received protocol headers to the specified\r\n              file.\r\n\r\n              This option is handy to use when you want to store  the  headers\r\n              that  an  HTTP site sends to you. Cookies from the headers could\r\n              then be read in a  second  curl  invocation  by  using  the  -b,\r\n              --cookie  option! The -c, --cookie-jar option is a better way to\r\n              store cookies.\r\n\r\n              If no headers are received, the use of this option  will  create\r\n              an empty file.\r\n\r\n              When  used  in FTP, the FTP server response lines are considered\r\n              being \"headers\" and thus are saved there.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n              See also -o, --output.\r\n\r\n       --egd-file <file>\r\n              (TLS) Specify the path name  to  the  Entropy  Gathering  Daemon\r\n              socket.  The  socket  is  used to seed the random engine for SSL\r\n              connections.\r\n\r\n              See also --random-file.\r\n\r\n       --engine <name>\r\n              (TLS) Select the OpenSSL crypto engine to use for cipher  opera-\r\n              tions. Use --engine list to print a list of build-time supported\r\n              engines. Note that not all (or  none)  of  the  engines  may  be\r\n              available at run-time.\r\n\r\n       --etag-compare <file>\r\n              (HTTP) This option makes a conditional HTTP request for the spe-\r\n              cific ETag read from the given file by sending a custom If-None-\r\n              Match header using the extracted ETag.\r\n\r\n              For correct results, make sure that specified file contains only\r\n              a single line with a desired ETag. An empty file is parsed as an\r\n              empty ETag.\r\n\r\n              Use  the  option  --etag-save  to first save the ETag from a re-\r\n              sponse, and then use this option to compare using the saved ETag\r\n              in a subsequent request.\r\n\r\n              OMPARISON:  There  are  2 types of comparison or ETags, Weak and\r\n              Strong.  This option expects, and uses a strong comparison.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.68.0.\r\n\r\n       --etag-save <file>\r\n              (HTTP) This option saves an HTTP ETag  to  the  specified  file.\r\n              Etag  is  usually  part  of  headers returned by a request. When\r\n              server sends an ETag, it must be enveloped by  a  double  quote.\r\n              This  option  extracts  the  ETag  without the double quotes and\r\n              saves it into the <file>.\r\n\r\n              A server can send a week ETag which is prefixed  by  \"W/\".  This\r\n              identifier  is  not  considered,  and only relevant ETag between\r\n              quotation marks is parsed.\r\n\r\n              It an ETag wasn't send by the server or it cannot be parsed, and\r\n              empty file is created.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.68.0.\r\n\r\n       --expect100-timeout <seconds>\r\n              (HTTP) Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl to wait for a\r\n              100-continue response when curl emits an  Expects:  100-continue\r\n              header  in  its  request.  By default curl will wait one second.\r\n              This option accepts decimal values! When curl stops waiting,  it\r\n              will continue as if the response has been received.\r\n\r\n              See also --connect-timeout. Added in 7.47.0.\r\n\r\n       --fail-early\r\n              Fail and exit on the first detected transfer error.\r\n\r\n              When  curl is used to do multiple transfers on the command line,\r\n              it will attempt to operate on each given URL, one by one. By de-\r\n              fault,  it  will  ignore errors if there are more URLs given and\r\n              the last URL's success will determine the error  code  curl  re-\r\n              turns. So early failures will be \"hidden\" by subsequent success-\r\n              ful transfers.\r\n\r\n              Using this option, curl will instead  return  an  error  on  the\r\n              first  transfer  that  fails,  independent of the amount of URLs\r\n              that are given on the command line. This way, no transfer  fail-\r\n              ures go undetected by scripts and similar.\r\n\r\n              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each\r\n              use of -:, --next.\r\n\r\n              This option does not imply -f, --fail, which causes transfers to\r\n              fail  due  to the server's HTTP status code. You can combine the\r\n              two options, however note -f, --fail is not global and is there-\r\n              fore contained by -:, --next.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.52.0.\r\n\r\n       -f, --fail\r\n              (HTTP)  Fail  silently (no output at all) on server errors. This\r\n              is mostly done to better enable scripts etc to better deal  with\r\n              failed  attempts.  In  normal cases when an HTTP server fails to\r\n              deliver a document, it  returns  an  HTML  document  stating  so\r\n              (which  often  also describes why and more). This flag will pre-\r\n              vent curl from outputting that and return error 22.\r\n\r\n              This method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where  non-\r\n              successful response codes will slip through, especially when au-\r\n              thentication is involved (response codes 401 and 407).\r\n\r\n       --false-start\r\n              (TLS) Tells curl to use false start during  the  TLS  handshake.\r\n              False  start is a mode where a TLS client will start sending ap-\r\n              plication data before verifying the server's  Finished  message,\r\n              thus saving a round trip when performing a full handshake.\r\n\r\n              This  is currently only implemented in the NSS and Secure Trans-\r\n              port (on iOS 7.0 or later, or OS X 10.9 or later) backends.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.42.0.\r\n\r\n       --form-string <name=string>\r\n              (HTTP SMTP IMAP) Similar to -F, --form  except  that  the  value\r\n              string  for  the  named parameter is used literally. Leading '@'\r\n              and '<' characters, and the ';type=' string in the value have no\r\n              special meaning. Use this in preference to -F, --form if there's\r\n              any possibility that the string value may  accidentally  trigger\r\n              the '@' or '<' features of -F, --form.\r\n\r\n              See also -F, --form.\r\n\r\n       -F, --form <name=content>\r\n              (HTTP  SMTP  IMAP) For HTTP protocol family, this lets curl emu-\r\n              late a filled-in form in which a user  has  pressed  the  submit\r\n              button.  This  causes  curl  to POST data using the Content-Type\r\n              multipart/form-data according to RFC 2388.\r\n\r\n              For SMTP and IMAP protocols, this is the mean to compose a  mul-\r\n              tipart mail message to transmit.\r\n\r\n              This  enables  uploading of binary files etc. To force the 'con-\r\n              tent' part to be a file, prefix the file name with an @ sign. To\r\n              just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with\r\n              the symbol <. The difference between @ and  <  is  then  that  @\r\n              makes  a  file  get attached in the post as a file upload, while\r\n              the < makes a text field and just get the contents for that text\r\n              field from a file.\r\n\r\n              Tell  curl to read content from stdin instead of a file by using\r\n              - as filename. This goes for both @ and < constructs. When stdin\r\n              is used, the contents is buffered in memory first by curl to de-\r\n              termine its size and allow a possible resend.  Defining a part's\r\n              data from a named non-regular file (such as a named pipe or sim-\r\n              ilar) is unfortunately not subject to buffering and will be  ef-\r\n              fectively  read at transmission time; since the full size is un-\r\n              known before the transfer starts, such data is sent as chunks by\r\n              HTTP and rejected by IMAP.\r\n\r\n              Example: send an image to an HTTP server, where 'profile' is the\r\n              name of the form-field to which the file  portrait.jpg  will  be\r\n              the input:\r\n\r\n               curl -F profile=@portrait.jpg https://example.com/upload.cgi\r\n\r\n              Example:  send your name and shoe size in two text fields to the\r\n              server:\r\n\r\n               curl -F name=John -F shoesize=11 https://example.com/\r\n\r\n              Example: send your essay in a text field to the server. Send  it\r\n              as  a plain text field, but get the contents for it from a local\r\n              file:\r\n\r\n               curl -F \"story=<hugefile.txt\" https://example.com/\r\n\r\n              You can also  tell  curl  what  Content-Type  to  use  by  using\r\n              'type=', in a manner similar to:\r\n\r\n               curl -F \"web=@index.html;type=text/html\" example.com\r\n\r\n              or\r\n\r\n               curl -F \"name=daniel;type=text/foo\" example.com\r\n\r\n              You  can  also explicitly change the name field of a file upload\r\n              part by setting filename=, like this:\r\n\r\n               curl -F \"file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost\" example.com\r\n\r\n              If filename/path contains ',' or ';', it must be quoted by  dou-\r\n              ble-quotes like:\r\n\r\n               curl   -F  \"file=@\\\"localfile\\\";filename=\\\"nameinpost\\\"\"  exam-\r\n              ple.com\r\n\r\n              or\r\n\r\n               curl -F 'file=@\"localfile\";filename=\"nameinpost\"' example.com\r\n\r\n              Note that if a filename/path is  quoted  by  double-quotes,  any\r\n              double-quote or backslash within the filename must be escaped by\r\n              backslash.\r\n\r\n              Quoting must also be applied to non-file  data  if  it  contains\r\n              semicolons, leading/trailing spaces or leading double quotes:\r\n\r\n               curl  -F  'colors=\"red;  green;  blue\";type=text/x-myapp' exam-\r\n              ple.com\r\n\r\n              You can add custom headers to the  field  by  setting  headers=,\r\n              like\r\n\r\n                curl -F \"submit=OK;headers=\\\"X-submit-type: OK\\\"\" example.com\r\n\r\n              or\r\n\r\n                curl -F \"submit=OK;headers=@headerfile\" example.com\r\n\r\n              The  headers=  keyword may appear more that once and above notes\r\n              about quoting apply. When headers are read from  a  file,  Empty\r\n              lines and lines starting with '#' are comments and ignored; each\r\n              header can be folded by splitting between two words and starting\r\n              the  continuation  line  with a space; embedded carriage-returns\r\n              and trailing spaces are stripped.   Here  is  an  example  of  a\r\n              header file contents:\r\n\r\n                # This file contain two headers.\r\n                X-header-1: this is a header\r\n\r\n                # The following header is folded.\r\n                X-header-2: this is\r\n                 another header\r\n\r\n              To  support  sending  multipart mail messages, the syntax is ex-\r\n              tended as follows:\r\n              - name can be omitted: the equal sign is the first character  of\r\n              the argument,\r\n              -  if  data  starts with '(', this signals to start a new multi-\r\n              part: it can be followed by a content type specification.\r\n              - a multipart can be terminated with a '=)' argument.\r\n\r\n              Example: the following command sends an SMTP  mime  e-mail  con-\r\n              sisting in an inline part in two alternative formats: plain text\r\n              and HTML.

When  connecting  to  Tumbleweed's  Secure\r\n              Transport  server  over  FTPS  using a client certificate, using\r\n              \"SITE AUTH\" will tell the server to retrieve the  username  from\r\n              the certificate.\r\n              Added in 7.15.5.\r\n\r\n       --ftp-create-dirs\r\n              (FTP  SFTP)  When  an FTP or SFTP URL/operation uses a path that\r\n              doesn't currently exist on the server, the standard behavior  of\r\n              curl is to fail. Using this option, curl will instead attempt to\r\n              create missing directories.\r\n\r\n              See also --create-dirs.\r\n\r\n       --ftp-method <method>\r\n              (FTP) Control what method curl should use to reach a file on  an\r\n              FTP(S)  server. The method argument should be one of the follow-\r\n              ing alternatives:\r\n\r\n              multicwd\r\n                     curl does a single CWD operation for each  path  part  in\r\n                     the  given URL. For deep hierarchies this means very many\r\n                     commands. This is how RFC 1738 says it  should  be  done.\r\n                     This is the default but the slowest behavior.\r\n\r\n              nocwd  curl  does  no  CWD at all. curl will do SIZE, RETR, STOR\r\n                     etc and give a full path to the server for all these com-\r\n                     mands. This is the fastest behavior.\r\n\r\n              singlecwd\r\n                     curl does one CWD with the full target directory and then\r\n                     operates on the file \"normally\"  (like  in  the  multicwd\r\n                     case).  This  is  somewhat  more standards compliant than\r\n                     'nocwd' but without the full penalty of 'multicwd'.\r\n\r\n       Added in 7.15.1.\r\n\r\n       --ftp-pasv\r\n              (FTP) Use passive mode for the data connection. Passive  is  the\r\n              internal  default behavior, but using this option can be used to\r\n              override a previous -P, --ftp-port option.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times,  only  the  first  one  is\r\n              used.  Undoing  an  enforced passive really isn't doable but you\r\n              must then instead enforce the correct -P, --ftp-port again.\r\n\r\n              Passive mode means that curl will try the EPSV command first and\r\n              then PASV, unless --disable-epsv is used.\r\n              See also --disable-epsv. Added in 7.11.0.\r\n\r\n       -P, --ftp-port <address>\r\n              (FTP)  Reverses  the  default initiator/listener roles when con-\r\n              necting with FTP. This option makes curl use active  mode.  curl\r\n              then  tells the server to connect back to the client's specified\r\n              address and port, while passive mode asks the server to setup an\r\n              IP  address  and  port for it to connect to. <address> should be\r\n              one of:\r\n\r\n              interface\r\n                     e.g. \"eth0\" to specify which interface's IP  address  you\r\n                     want to use (Unix only)\r\n\r\n              IP address\r\n                     e.g. \"192.168.10.1\" to specify the exact IP address\r\n\r\n              host name\r\n                     e.g. \"my.host.domain\" to specify the machine\r\n\r\n              -      make  curl  pick the same IP address that is already used\r\n                     for the control connection\r\n\r\n       If this option is used several times, the last one will be  used.  Dis-\r\n       able  the  use  of PORT with --ftp-pasv. Disable the attempt to use the\r\n       EPRT command instead of PORT by using --disable-eprt.  EPRT  is  really\r\n       PORT++.\r\n\r\n       Since  7.19.5,  you can append \":[start]-[end]\" to the right of the ad-\r\n       dress, to tell curl what TCP port range to use. That means you  specify\r\n       a port range, from a lower to a higher number. A single number works as\r\n       well, but do note that it increases the risk of failure since the  port\r\n       may not be available.\r\n\r\n       See also --ftp-pasv and --disable-eprt.\r\n\r\n       --ftp-pret\r\n              (FTP)  Tell  curl to send a PRET command before PASV (and EPSV).\r\n              Certain FTP servers, mainly drftpd,  require  this  non-standard\r\n              command  for  directory  listings as well as up and downloads in\r\n              PASV mode.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.20.0.\r\n\r\n       --ftp-skip-pasv-ip\r\n              (FTP) Tell curl to not use the IP address the server suggests in\r\n              its  response to curl's PASV command when curl connects the data\r\n              connection. Instead curl will re-use the same IP address it  al-\r\n              ready uses for the control connection.\r\n\r\n              This  option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used instead\r\n              of PASV.\r\n\r\n              See also --ftp-pasv. Added in 7.14.2.\r\n\r\n       --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode <active/passive>\r\n              (FTP) Sets the CCC mode. The passive mode will not initiate  the\r\n              shutdown, but instead wait for the server to do it, and will not\r\n              reply to the shutdown from the server. The active mode initiates\r\n              the shutdown and waits for a reply from the server.\r\n\r\n              See also --ftp-ssl-ccc. Added in 7.16.2.\r\n\r\n       --ftp-ssl-ccc\r\n              (FTP)  Use  CCC  (Clear  Command Channel) Shuts down the SSL/TLS\r\n              layer after authenticating. The rest of the control channel com-\r\n              munication  will be unencrypted. This allows NAT routers to fol-\r\n              low the FTP transaction. The default mode is passive.\r\n\r\n              See also --ssl and --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode. Added in 7.16.1.\r\n\r\n       --ftp-ssl-control\r\n              (FTP) Require SSL/TLS for the FTP  login,  clear  for  transfer.\r\n              Allows  secure  authentication, but non-encrypted data transfers\r\n              for efficiency.  Fails the transfer if the server  doesn't  sup-\r\n              port SSL/TLS.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.16.0.\r\n\r\n       -G, --get\r\n              When  used,  this  option  will make all data specified with -d,\r\n              --data, --data-binary or --data-urlencode to be used in an  HTTP\r\n              GET  request instead of the POST request that otherwise would be\r\n              used. The data will be appended to the URL with a '?' separator.\r\n              If used in combination with -I, --head, the POST data  will  in-\r\n              stead be appended to the URL with a HEAD request.\r\n\r\n              If  this  option  is  used  several times, only the first one is\r\n              used. This is because undoing a GET doesn't make sense, but  you\r\n              should then instead enforce the alternative method you prefer.\r\n\r\n       -g, --globoff\r\n              This option switches off the \"URL globbing parser\". When you set\r\n              this option, you can specify URLs that contain the letters  {}[]\r\n              without  having them being interpreted by curl itself. Note that\r\n              these letters are not normal legal URL contents but they  should\r\n              be encoded according to the URI standard.\r\n\r\n       --happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms <milliseconds>\r\n              Happy  eyeballs is an algorithm that attempts to connect to both\r\n              IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for dual-stack  hosts,  preferring  IPv6\r\n              first for the number of milliseconds. If the IPv6 address cannot\r\n              be connected to within that time then a  connection  attempt  is\r\n              made to the IPv4 address in parallel. The first connection to be\r\n              established is the one that is used.\r\n\r\n              The range of suggested useful values is limited. Happy  Eyeballs\r\n              RFC  6555  says  \"It  is RECOMMENDED that connection attempts be\r\n              paced 150-250 ms apart to balance human factors against  network\r\n              load.\"  libcurl currently defaults to 200 ms. Firefox and Chrome\r\n              currently default to 300 ms.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.59.0.\r\n\r\n       --haproxy-protocol\r\n              (HTTP) Send a HAProxy PROXY protocol v1 header at the  beginning\r\n              of  the  connection. This is used by some load balancers and re-\r\n              verse proxies to indicate the client's true IP address and port.\r\n              This option is primarily useful when sending test requests to  a\r\n              service that expects this header.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.60.0.\r\n\r\n       -I, --head\r\n              (HTTP FTP FILE) Fetch the headers only! HTTP-servers feature the\r\n              command HEAD which this uses to get nothing but the header of  a\r\n              document.  When  used  on an FTP or FILE file, curl displays the\r\n              file size and last modification time only.\r\n\r\n       -H, --header <header/@file>\r\n              (HTTP) Extra header to include in the request when sending  HTTP\r\n              to  a  server. You may specify any number of extra headers. Note\r\n              that if you should add a custom header that has the same name as\r\n              one  of  the  internal  ones curl would use, your externally set\r\n              header will be used instead of the internal one. This allows you\r\n              to  make  even  trickier  stuff than curl would normally do. You\r\n              should not replace internally set headers without  knowing  per-\r\n              fectly well what you're doing. Remove an internal header by giv-\r\n              ing a replacement without content  on  the  right  side  of  the\r\n              colon, as in: -H \"Host:\". If you send the custom header with no-\r\n              value then its header must be terminated with a semicolon,  such\r\n              as -H \"X-Custom-Header;\" to send \"X-Custom-Header:\".\r\n\r\n              curl  will  make  sure  that each header you add/replace is sent\r\n              with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus not add that\r\n              as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage\r\n              returns, they will only mess things up for you.\r\n\r\n              Starting in 7.55.0, this option can take an argument  in  @file-\r\n              name  style, which then adds a header for each line in the input\r\n              file. Using @- will make curl read the header file from stdin.\r\n\r\n              See also the -A, --user-agent and -e, --referer options.\r\n\r\n              Starting in 7.37.0, you need --proxy-header to send custom head-\r\n              ers intended for a proxy.\r\n\r\n              Example:\r\n\r\n               curl -H \"X-First-Name: Joe\" http://example.com/\r\n\r\n              WARNING:  headers  set  with  this option will be set in all re-\r\n              quests - even after redirects are followed, like when told  with\r\n              -L,  --location. This can lead to the header being sent to other\r\n              hosts than the original host, so  sensitive  headers  should  be\r\n              used with caution combined with following redirects.\r\n\r\n              This  option  can  be  used multiple times to add/replace/remove\r\n              multiple headers.\r\n\r\n       -h, --help\r\n              Usage help.

Added in 7.66.0.\r\n\r\n       --ignore-content-length\r\n              (FTP HTTP) For HTTP, Ignore the Content-Length header.  This  is\r\n              particularly  useful  for servers running Apache 1.x, which will\r\n              report incorrect Content-Length for files larger  than  2  giga-\r\n              bytes.\r\n\r\n              For  FTP (since 7.46.0), skip the RETR command to figure out the\r\n              size before downloading a file.\r\n\r\n       -i, --include\r\n              Include the HTTP response headers in the output.  The  HTTP  re-\r\n              sponse  headers  can  include  things like server name, cookies,\r\n              date of the document, HTTP version and more...\r\n\r\n              To view the request headers, consider the -v, --verbose option.\r\n\r\n              See also -v, --verbose.\r\n\r\n       -k, --insecure\r\n              (TLS) By default, every SSL connection curl makes is verified to\r\n              be  secure.  This option allows curl to proceed and operate even\r\n              for server connections otherwise considered insecure.\r\n\r\n              The server connection is verified by making  sure  the  server's\r\n              certificate  contains  the  right name and verifies successfully\r\n              using the cert store.\r\n\r\n              See this online resource for further details:\r\n               https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html\r\n              See also --proxy-insecure and --cacert.\r\n\r\n       --interface <name>\r\n\r\n              Perform an operation using a specified interface. You can  enter\r\n              interface  name,  IP address or host name. An example could look\r\n              like:\r\n\r\n               curl --interface eth0:1 https://www.example.com/\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n              On Linux it can be used to specify a VRF, but the  binary  needs\r\n              to  either  have CAP_NET_RAW or to be run as root.

This will ba-\r\n              sically  have  the  same  effect as if a new session is started.\r\n              Typical browsers always discard  session  cookies  when  they're\r\n              closed down.\r\n\r\n              See also -b, --cookie and -c, --cookie-jar.\r\n\r\n       --keepalive-time <seconds>\r\n              This  option sets the time a connection needs to remain idle be-\r\n              fore sending keepalive probes and the  time  between  individual\r\n              keepalive probes. It is currently effective on operating systems\r\n              offering  the  TCP_KEEPIDLE  and  TCP_KEEPINTVL  socket  options\r\n              (meaning  Linux, recent AIX, HP-UX and more). This option has no\r\n              effect if --no-keepalive is used.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n              If unspecified, the option defaults to 60 seconds.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.18.0.\r\n\r\n       --key-type <type>\r\n              (TLS)  Private key file type. Specify which type your --key pro-\r\n              vided private key is. DER, PEM, and ENG are  supported.  If  not\r\n              specified, PEM is assumed.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       --key <key>\r\n              (TLS SSH) Private key file name. Allows you to provide your pri-\r\n              vate key in this separate file. For SSH, if not specified,  curl\r\n              tries   the  following  candidates  in  order:  '~/.ssh/id_rsa',\r\n              '~/.ssh/id_dsa', './id_rsa', './id_dsa'.\r\n\r\n              If curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine  pkcs11\r\n              is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be used to spec-\r\n              ify a private key located in a PKCS#11 device. A  string  begin-\r\n              ning  with  \"pkcs11:\" will be interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI. If a\r\n              PKCS#11 URI is provided, then the --engine option will be set as\r\n              \"pkcs11\"  if none was provided and the --key-type option will be\r\n              set as \"ENG\" if none was provided.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       --krb <level>\r\n              (FTP) Enable Kerberos authentication and use. The level must  be\r\n              entered and should be one of 'clear', 'safe', 'confidential', or\r\n              'private'. Should you use a level that  is  not  one  of  these,\r\n              'private' will instead be used.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n              --krb  requires that the underlying libcurl was built to support\r\n              Kerberos.\r\n\r\n       --libcurl <file>\r\n              Append this option to any ordinary curl command  line,  and  you\r\n              will  get a libcurl-using C source code written to the file that\r\n              does the equivalent of what your command-line operation does!\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last given  file  name\r\n              will be used.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.16.1.\r\n\r\n       --limit-rate <speed>\r\n              Specify  the  maximum  transfer  rate you want curl to use - for\r\n              both downloads and uploads. This feature is useful if you have a\r\n              limited pipe and you'd like your transfer not to use your entire\r\n              bandwidth. To make it slower than it otherwise would be.\r\n\r\n              The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix  is\r\n              appended.   Appending  'k' or 'K' will count the number as kilo-\r\n              bytes, 'm' or 'M' makes it megabytes, while 'g' or 'G' makes  it\r\n              gigabytes. Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.\r\n\r\n              If  you  also use the -Y, --speed-limit option, that option will\r\n              take precedence and might cripple the rate-limiting slightly, to\r\n              help keeping the speed-limit logic working.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       -l, --list-only\r\n              (FTP  POP3)  (FTP)  When  listing  an FTP directory, this switch\r\n              forces a name-only view. This is especially useful if  the  user\r\n              wants  to  machine-parse  the contents of an FTP directory since\r\n              the normal directory view doesn't use a standard look or format.\r\n              When used like this, the option causes a NLST command to be sent\r\n              to the server instead of LIST.\r\n\r\n              Note: Some FTP servers list only  files  in  their  response  to\r\n              NLST; they do not include sub-directories and symbolic links.\r\n\r\n              (POP3)  When  retrieving a specific email from POP3, this switch\r\n              forces a LIST command to be performed instead of RETR.  This  is\r\n              particularly  useful if the user wants to see if a specific mes-\r\n              sage id exists on the server and what size it is.\r\n\r\n              Note: When combined with -X, --request, this option can be  used\r\n              to send an UIDL command instead, so the user may use the email's\r\n              unique identifier rather than it's message id to  make  the  re-\r\n              quest.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.21.5.\r\n\r\n       --local-port <num/range>\r\n              Set  a  preferred single number or range (FROM-TO) of local port\r\n              numbers to use for the connection(s).  Note that port numbers by\r\n              nature  are a scarce resource that will be busy at times so set-\r\n              ting this range to something too narrow might cause  unnecessary\r\n              connection setup failures.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.15.2.\r\n\r\n       --location-trusted\r\n              (HTTP)  Like  -L,  --location, but will allow sending the name +\r\n              password to all hosts that the site may redirect to. This may or\r\n              may not introduce a security breach if the site redirects you to\r\n              a site to which you'll send your authentication info  (which  is\r\n              plaintext in the case of HTTP Basic authentication).\r\n\r\n              See also -u, --user.\r\n\r\n       -L, --location\r\n              (HTTP)  If  the server reports that the requested page has moved\r\n              to a different location (indicated with a Location: header and a\r\n              3XX  response code), this option will make curl redo the request\r\n              on the new place. If used together with  -i,  --include  or  -I,\r\n              --head, headers from all requested pages will be shown. When au-\r\n              thentication is used, curl only sends  its  credentials  to  the\r\n              initial  host.  If a redirect takes curl to a different host, it\r\n              won't be able to intercept the user+password. See  also  --loca-\r\n              tion-trusted  on how to change this. You can limit the amount of\r\n              redirects to follow by using the --max-redirs option.\r\n\r\n              When curl follows a redirect and if the request is  a  POST,  it\r\n              will  do  the  following request with a GET if the HTTP response\r\n              was 301, 302, or 303. If the response code  was  any  other  3xx\r\n              code, curl will re-send the following request using the same un-\r\n              modified method.\r\n\r\n              You can tell curl to not change POST requests to GET after a 30x\r\n              response  by  using  the  dedicated options for that: --post301,\r\n              --post302 and --post303.\r\n\r\n              The method set with -X,  --request  overrides  the  method  curl\r\n              would otherwise select to use.\r\n\r\n       --login-options <options>\r\n              (IMAP  POP3 SMTP) Specify the login options to use during server\r\n              authentication.\r\n\r\n              You can use the login options to specify protocol  specific  op-\r\n              tions  that  may  be used during authentication. At present only\r\n              IMAP, POP3 and SMTP support login options.

This will be  used  to  specify\r\n              the  authentication  address  (identity)  of a submitted message\r\n              that is being relayed to another server.\r\n\r\n              See also --mail-rcpt and --mail-from. Added in 7.25.0.\r\n\r\n       --mail-from <address>\r\n              (SMTP) Specify a single address that the given mail  should  get\r\n              sent from.\r\n\r\n              See also --mail-rcpt and --mail-auth. Added in 7.20.0.\r\n\r\n       --mail-rcpt-allowfails\r\n              (SMTP) When sending data to multiple recipients, by default curl\r\n              will abort SMTP conversation if at least one of  the  recipients\r\n              causes RCPT TO command to return an error.\r\n\r\n              The  default  behavior can be changed by passing --mail-rcpt-al-\r\n              lowfails command-line option which will make curl ignore  errors\r\n              and proceed with the remaining valid recipients.\r\n\r\n              In  case when all recipients cause RCPT TO command to fail, curl\r\n              will abort SMTP conversation and return the error received  from\r\n              to the last RCPT TO command.  Added in 7.69.0.\r\n\r\n       --mail-rcpt <address>\r\n              (SMTP) Specify a single address, user name or mailing list name.\r\n              Repeat this option several times to send to multiple recipients.\r\n              When performing a mail transfer, the recipient should specify  a\r\n              valid email address to send the mail to.\r\n\r\n              When  performing an address verification (VRFY command), the re-\r\n              cipient should be specified as the user name or  user  name  and\r\n              domain (as per Section 3.5 of RFC5321). (Added in 7.34.0)\r\n\r\n              When performing a mailing list expand (EXPN command), the recip-\r\n              ient should be specified using the mailing list  name,  such  as\r\n              \"Friends\" or \"London-Office\".  (Added in 7.34.0)\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.20.0.\r\n\r\n       -M, --manual\r\n              Manual. Display the huge help text.\r\n\r\n       --max-filesize <bytes>\r\n              Specify  the  maximum  size (in bytes) of a file to download. If\r\n              the file requested is larger than this value, the transfer  will\r\n              not start and curl will return with exit code 63.\r\n\r\n              A  size  modifier may be used. For example, Appending 'k' or 'K'\r\n              will count  the  number  as  kilobytes,  'm'  or  'M'  makes  it\r\n              megabytes,  while 'g' or 'G' makes it gigabytes. Examples: 200K,\r\n              3m and 1G. (Added in 7.58.0)\r\n\r\n              NOTE: The file size is not always known prior to  download,  and\r\n              for such files this option has no effect even if the file trans-\r\n              fer ends up being larger than this given  limit.  This  concerns\r\n              both FTP and HTTP transfers.\r\n\r\n              See also --limit-rate.\r\n\r\n       --max-redirs <num>\r\n              (HTTP)  Set  maximum  number  of redirection-followings allowed.\r\n              When -L, --location is used, is used to prevent curl  from  fol-\r\n              lowing redirections too much. By default, the limit is set to 50\r\n              redirections. Set this option to -1 to make it unlimited.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       -m, --max-time <seconds>\r\n              Maximum time in seconds that you allow the  whole  operation  to\r\n              take.   This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from hang-\r\n              ing for hours due to slow networks or links going  down.   Since\r\n              7.32.0, this option accepts decimal values, but the actual time-\r\n              out will decrease in accuracy as the specified timeout increases\r\n              in decimal precision.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n              See also --connect-timeout.\r\n\r\n       --metalink\r\n              This  option  can  tell curl to parse and process a given URI as\r\n              Metalink file (both version 3 and 4 (RFC  5854)  are  supported)\r\n              and  make use of the mirrors listed within for failover if there\r\n              are errors (such as the file or server not being available).  It\r\n              will  also  verify  the hash of the file after the download com-\r\n              pletes. The Metalink file itself is downloaded and processed  in\r\n              memory and not stored in the local file system.\r\n\r\n              Example to use a remote Metalink file:\r\n\r\n               curl --metalink http://www.example.com/example.metalink\r\n\r\n              To use a Metalink file in the local file system, use FILE proto-\r\n              col (file://):\r\n\r\n               curl --metalink file://example.metalink\r\n\r\n              Please note that if FILE protocol is disabled, there is  no  way\r\n              to  use  a local Metalink file at the time of this writing. Also\r\n              note that if --metalink and -i,  --include  are  used  together,\r\n              --include  will be ignored. This is because including headers in\r\n              the response will break Metalink parser and if the  headers  are\r\n              included in the file described in Metalink file, hash check will\r\n              fail.\r\n\r\n              --metalink requires that the underlying  libcurl  was  built  to\r\n              support metalink. Added in 7.27.0.\r\n\r\n       --negotiate\r\n              (HTTP) Enables Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication.\r\n\r\n              This  option  requires a library built with GSS-API or SSPI sup-\r\n              port. Use -V, --version  to  see  if  your  curl  supports  GSS-\r\n              API/SSPI or SPNEGO.\r\n\r\n              When  using this option, you must also provide a fake -u, --user\r\n              option to activate the authentication code properly.  Sending  a\r\n              '-u  :'  is  enough  as  the user name and password from the -u,\r\n              --user option aren't actually used.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times,  only  the  first  one  is\r\n              used.\r\n\r\n              See also --basic and --ntlm and --anyauth and --proxy-negotiate.\r\n\r\n       --netrc-file <filename>\r\n              This  option  is similar to -n, --netrc, except that you provide\r\n              the path (absolute or relative) to  the  netrc  file  that  curl\r\n              should use.  You can only specify one netrc file per invocation.\r\n              If several --netrc-file options are provided, the last one  will\r\n              be used.\r\n\r\n              It will abide by --netrc-optional if specified.\r\n\r\n              This option overrides -n, --netrc. Added in 7.21.5.\r\n\r\n       --netrc-optional\r\n              Very  similar  to  -n, --netrc, but this option makes the .netrc\r\n              usage optional and not mandatory as the -n, --netrc option does.\r\n\r\n              See also --netrc-file. This option overrides -n, --netrc.\r\n\r\n       -n, --netrc\r\n              Makes curl scan the .netrc  (_netrc  on  Windows)  file  in  the\r\n              user's home directory for login name and password. This is typi-\r\n              cally used for FTP on Unix. If used with HTTP, curl will  enable\r\n              user authentication. See netrc(5) ftp(1) for details on the file\r\n              format. Curl will not complain if that  file  doesn't  have  the\r\n              right permissions (it should not be either world- or group-read-\r\n              able). The environment variable \"HOME\" is used to find the  home\r\n              directory.\r\n\r\n              A  quick and very simple example of how to setup a .netrc to al-\r\n              low curl to FTP to the machine host.domain.com  with  user  name\r\n              'myself' and password 'secret' should look similar to:\r\n\r\n              machine host.domain.com login myself password secret\r\n\r\n       -:, --next\r\n              Tells curl to use a separate operation for the following URL and\r\n              associated options. This allows you  to  send  several  URL  re-\r\n              quests,  each with their own specific options, for example, such\r\n              as different user names or custom requests for each.\r\n\r\n              -:, --next will reset all local options  and  only  global  ones\r\n              will  have  their values survive over to the operation following\r\n              the -:, --next instruction. Global options  include  -v,  --ver-\r\n              bose, --trace, --trace-ascii and --fail-early.\r\n\r\n              For  example,  you can do both a GET and a POST in a single com-\r\n              mand line:\r\n\r\n               curl www1.example.com --next -d postthis www2.example.com\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.36.0.\r\n\r\n       --no-alpn\r\n              (HTTPS) Disable the ALPN TLS extension. ALPN is enabled  by  de-\r\n              fault  if  libcurl  was  built with an SSL library that supports\r\n              ALPN. ALPN is used by a libcurl that supports HTTP/2 to  negoti-\r\n              ate HTTP/2 support with the server during https sessions.\r\n\r\n              See  also  --no-npn and --http2. --no-alpn requires that the un-\r\n              derlying libcurl was built to support TLS. Added in 7.36.0.\r\n\r\n       -N, --no-buffer\r\n              Disables the buffering of the output stream. In normal work sit-\r\n              uations,  curl  will  use a standard buffered output stream that\r\n              will have the effect that it will output the data in chunks, not\r\n              necessarily  exactly  when  the data arrives.  Using this option\r\n              will disable that buffering.\r\n\r\n              Note that this is the negated option name  documented.  You  can\r\n              thus use --buffer to enforce the buffering.\r\n\r\n       --no-keepalive\r\n              Disables  the  use  of keepalive messages on the TCP connection.\r\n              curl otherwise enables them by default.\r\n\r\n              Note that this is the negated option name  documented.  You  can\r\n              thus use --keepalive to enforce keepalive.\r\n\r\n       --no-npn\r\n              (HTTPS) Disable the NPN TLS extension. NPN is enabled by default\r\n              if libcurl was built with an SSL library that supports NPN.  NPN\r\n              is  used  by  a libcurl that supports HTTP/2 to negotiate HTTP/2\r\n              support with the server during https sessions.\r\n\r\n              See also --no-alpn and --http2. --no-npn requires that  the  un-\r\n              derlying libcurl was built to support TLS. Added in 7.36.0.\r\n\r\n       --no-progress-meter\r\n              Option to switch off the progress meter output without muting or\r\n              otherwise affecting warning and informational messages like  -s,\r\n              --silent does.\r\n\r\n              Note  that  this  is the negated option name documented. You can\r\n              thus use --progress-meter to enable the progress meter again.\r\n\r\n              See also -v, --verbose and -s, --silent. Added in 7.67.0.\r\n\r\n       --no-sessionid\r\n              (TLS) Disable curl's use of SSL session-ID caching.  By  default\r\n              all  transfers are done using the cache. Note that while nothing\r\n              should ever get hurt by attempting  to  reuse  SSL  session-IDs,\r\n              there seem to be broken SSL implementations in the wild that may\r\n              require you to disable this in order for you to succeed.\r\n\r\n              Note that this is the negated option name  documented.  You  can\r\n              thus use --sessionid to enforce session-ID caching.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.16.0.\r\n\r\n       --noproxy <no-proxy-list>\r\n              Comma-separated  list  of hosts which do not use a proxy, if one\r\n              is specified.  The only wildcard is a single * character,  which\r\n              matches all hosts, and effectively disables the proxy. Each name\r\n              in this list is matched as either a domain  which  contains  the\r\n              hostname,  or  the hostname itself. For example, local.com would\r\n              match  local.com,  local.com:80,  and  www.local.com,  but   not\r\n              www.notlocal.com.\r\n\r\n              Since  7.53.0,  This  option overrides the environment variables\r\n              that disable the proxy. If there's an environment variable  dis-\r\n              abling a proxy, you can set noproxy list to \"\" to override it.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.19.4.\r\n\r\n       --ntlm-wb\r\n              (HTTP) Enables NTLM much in the style --ntlm does, but hand over\r\n              the authentication to the separate binary  ntlmauth  application\r\n              that is executed when needed.\r\n\r\n              See also --ntlm and --proxy-ntlm.\r\n\r\n       --ntlm (HTTP)  Enables  NTLM  authentication.  The  NTLM authentication\r\n              method was designed by Microsoft and is used by IIS web servers.\r\n              It  is a proprietary protocol, reverse-engineered by clever peo-\r\n              ple and implemented in curl based on their efforts. This kind of\r\n              behavior  should  not be endorsed, you should encourage everyone\r\n              who uses NTLM to switch to a public and  documented  authentica-\r\n              tion method instead, such as Digest.\r\n\r\n              If  you  want to enable NTLM for your proxy authentication, then\r\n              use --proxy-ntlm.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times,  only  the  first  one  is\r\n              used.\r\n\r\n              See  also  --proxy-ntlm.  --ntlm  requires  that  the underlying\r\n              libcurl was built to support TLS. This option overrides  --basic\r\n              and --negotiate and --digest and --anyauth.\r\n\r\n       --oauth2-bearer <token>\r\n              (IMAP  POP3  SMTP  HTTP)  Specify the Bearer Token for OAUTH 2.0\r\n              server authentication. The Bearer Token is used  in  conjunction\r\n              with  the  user name which can be specified as part of the --url\r\n              or -u, --user options.\r\n\r\n              The Bearer Token and user name are formatted  according  to  RFC\r\n              6750.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       -o, --output <file>\r\n              Write output to <file> instead of stdout. If you are using {} or\r\n              [] to fetch multiple documents, you can use '#'  followed  by  a\r\n              number  in  the <file> specifier. That variable will be replaced\r\n              with the current string for the URL being fetched. Like in:\r\n\r\n               curl http://{one,two}.example.com -o \"file_#1.txt\"\r\n\r\n              or use several variables like:\r\n\r\n               curl http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com -o \"#1_#2\"\r\n\r\n              You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs  you\r\n              have.  For  example, if you specify two URLs on the same command\r\n              line, you can use it like this:\r\n\r\n                curl -o aa example.com -o bb example.net\r\n\r\n              and the order of the -o options and  the  URLs  doesn't  matter,\r\n              just  that  the  first -o is for the first URL and so on, so the\r\n              above command line can also be written as\r\n\r\n                curl example.com example.net -o aa -o bb\r\n\r\n              See also the --create-dirs option to create the  local  directo-\r\n              ries  dynamically.  Specifying the output as '-' (a single dash)\r\n              will force the output to be done to stdout.\r\n\r\n              See also -O, --remote-name and --remote-name-all and  -J,  --re-\r\n              mote-header-name.\r\n\r\n       --parallel-immediate\r\n              When  doing  parallel  transfers, this option will instruct curl\r\n              that it should rather prefer opening up more connections in par-\r\n              allel at once rather than waiting to see if new transfers can be\r\n              added as multiplexed streams on another connection.\r\n\r\n              See also -Z, --parallel and --parallel-max. Added in 7.68.0.\r\n\r\n       --parallel-max\r\n              When asked to do parallel transfers, using -Z, --parallel,  this\r\n              option controls the maximum amount of transfers to do simultane-\r\n              ously.\r\n\r\n              The default is 50.\r\n\r\n              See also -Z, --parallel.

In such a case curl  first  connects  to  the\r\n              SOCKS  proxy  and  then  connects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or\r\n              HTTPS proxy. Hence pre proxy.\r\n\r\n              The pre proxy string should be specified with a protocol:// pre-\r\n              fix  to  specify  alternative  proxy  protocols.  Use socks4://,\r\n              socks4a://, socks5:// or  socks5h://  to  request  the  specific\r\n              SOCKS  version  to be used. No protocol specified will make curl\r\n              default to SOCKS4.\r\n\r\n              If the port number is not specified in the proxy string,  it  is\r\n              assumed to be 1080.\r\n\r\n              User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are\r\n              URL decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special  charac-\r\n              ters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.52.0.\r\n\r\n       -#, --progress-bar\r\n              Make curl display transfer progress as a simple progress bar in-\r\n              stead of the standard, more informational, meter.\r\n\r\n              This progress bar draws a single line of '#'  characters  across\r\n              the screen and shows a percentage if the transfer size is known.\r\n              For transfers without a known size, there  will  be  space  ship\r\n              (-=o=-)  that  moves back and forth but only while data is being\r\n              transferred, with a set of flying hash sign symbols on top.\r\n\r\n       --proto-default <protocol>\r\n              Tells curl to use protocol for any URL missing a scheme name.\r\n\r\n              Example:\r\n\r\n               curl --proto-default https ftp.mozilla.org\r\n\r\n              An unknown or unsupported  protocol  causes  error  CURLE_UNSUP-\r\n              PORTED_PROTOCOL (1).\r\n\r\n              This option does not change the default proxy protocol (http).\r\n\r\n              Without  this  option curl would make a guess based on the host,\r\n              see --url for details.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.45.0.\r\n\r\n       --proto-redir <protocols>\r\n              Tells curl to limit what protocols it may use on redirect.  Pro-\r\n              tocols  denied by --proto are not overridden by this option. See\r\n              --proto for how protocols are represented.\r\n\r\n              Example, allow only HTTP and HTTPS on redirect:\r\n\r\n               curl --proto-redir -all,http,https http://example.com\r\n\r\n              By default curl will allow HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS on redirect\r\n              (7.65.2).  Older versions of curl allowed all protocols on redi-\r\n              rect except several disabled for security reasons: Since  7.19.4\r\n              FILE  and  SCP  are  disabled, and since 7.40.0 SMB and SMBS are\r\n              also disabled. Specifying all or +all enables all  protocols  on\r\n              redirect, including those disabled for security.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.20.2.\r\n\r\n       --proto <protocols>\r\n              Tells  curl  to limit what protocols it may use in the transfer.\r\n              Protocols are evaluated left to right, are comma separated,  and\r\n              are  each  a protocol name or 'all', optionally prefixed by zero\r\n              or more modifiers. Available modifiers are:\r\n\r\n              +  Permit this protocol in addition to protocols already permit-\r\n                 ted (this is the default if no modifier is used).\r\n\r\n              -  Deny  this  protocol,  removing it from the list of protocols\r\n                 already permitted.\r\n\r\n              =  Permit only this protocol (ignoring the list already  permit-\r\n                 ted),  though subject to later modification by subsequent en-\r\n                 tries in the comma separated list.\r\n\r\n              For example:\r\n\r\n              --proto -ftps  uses the default protocols, but disables ftps\r\n\r\n              --proto -all,https,+http\r\n                             only enables http and https\r\n\r\n              --proto =http,https\r\n                             also only enables http and https\r\n\r\n       Unknown protocols produce a warning. This allows scripts to safely rely\r\n       on being able to disable potentially dangerous protocols, without rely-\r\n       ing upon support for that protocol being built into curl  to  avoid  an\r\n       error.\r\n\r\n       This option can be used multiple times, in which case the effect is the\r\n       same as concatenating the protocols into one instance of the option.\r\n\r\n       See also --proto-redir and --proto-default. Added in 7.20.2.\r\n\r\n       --proxy-anyauth\r\n              Tells curl to pick a suitable authentication method when  commu-\r\n              nicating  with  the  given HTTP proxy. This might cause an extra\r\n              request/response round-trip.\r\n\r\n              See also -x, --proxy and --proxy-basic and --proxy-digest. Added\r\n              in 7.13.2.\r\n\r\n       --proxy-basic\r\n              Tells  curl  to use HTTP Basic authentication when communicating\r\n              with the given proxy. Use --basic for enabling HTTP Basic with a\r\n              remote  host.  Basic  is  the default authentication method curl\r\n              uses with proxies.\r\n\r\n              See also -x, --proxy and --proxy-anyauth and --proxy-digest.\r\n\r\n       --proxy-cacert <file>\r\n              Same as --cacert but used in HTTPS proxy context.\r\n\r\n              See also  --proxy-capath  and  --cacert  and  --capath  and  -x,\r\n              --proxy.

Use --digest for enabling HTTP Digest with\r\n              a remote host.\r\n\r\n              See also -x, --proxy and --proxy-anyauth and --proxy-basic.\r\n\r\n       --proxy-header <header/@file>\r\n              (HTTP) Extra header to include in the request when sending  HTTP\r\n              to a proxy. You may specify any number of extra headers. This is\r\n              the equivalent option to -H, --header but is for proxy  communi-\r\n              cation  only  like  in CONNECT requests when you want a separate\r\n              header sent to the proxy to what is sent to  the  actual  remote\r\n              host.\r\n\r\n              curl  will  make  sure  that each header you add/replace is sent\r\n              with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus not add that\r\n              as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage\r\n              returns, they will only mess things up for you.\r\n\r\n              Headers specified with this option will not be included  in  re-\r\n              quests that curl knows will not be sent to a proxy.\r\n\r\n              Starting  in  7.55.0, this option can take an argument in @file-\r\n              name style, which then adds a header for each line in the  input\r\n              file. Using @- will make curl read the header file from stdin.\r\n\r\n              This  option  can  be  used multiple times to add/replace/remove\r\n              multiple headers.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.37.0.\r\n       --proxy-insecure\r\n              Same as -k, --insecure but used in HTTPS proxy context.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.52.0.\r\n\r\n       --proxy-key-type <type>\r\n              Same as --key-type but used in HTTPS proxy context.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.52.0.\r\n\r\n       --proxy-key <key>\r\n              Same as --key but used in HTTPS proxy context.\r\n\r\n       --proxy-negotiate\r\n              Tells curl to use HTTP Negotiate  (SPNEGO)  authentication  when\r\n              communicating with the given proxy. Use --negotiate for enabling\r\n              HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO) with a remote host.\r\n\r\n              See also --proxy-anyauth and --proxy-basic.

Prior versions may ignore the  protocol  and  use\r\n              http:// instead.\r\n\r\n              If  the  port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is\r\n              assumed to be 1080.\r\n\r\n              This option overrides existing environment  variables  that  set\r\n              the  proxy  to use. If there's an environment variable setting a\r\n              proxy, you can set proxy to \"\" to override it.\r\n\r\n              All operations that are performed over an HTTP proxy will trans-\r\n              parently  be  converted  to HTTP. It means that certain protocol\r\n              specific operations might not be available. This is not the case\r\n              if you can tunnel through the proxy, as one with the -p, --prox-\r\n              ytunnel option.\r\n\r\n              User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are\r\n              URL  decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special charac-\r\n              ters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.\r\n\r\n              The proxy host can be specified the exact same way as the  proxy\r\n              environment  variables,  including the protocol prefix (http://)\r\n              and the embedded user + password.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       --proxy1.0 <host[:port]>\r\n              Use the specified HTTP 1.0 proxy. If  the  port  number  is  not\r\n              specified, it is assumed at port 1080.\r\n\r\n              The  only  difference between this and the HTTP proxy option -x,\r\n              --proxy, is that attempts to use CONNECT through the proxy  will\r\n              specify an HTTP 1.0 protocol instead of the default HTTP 1.1.\r\n\r\n       -p, --proxytunnel\r\n              When  an  HTTP  proxy is used -x, --proxy, this option will make\r\n              curl tunnel through the proxy. The tunnel approach is made  with\r\n              the  HTTP  proxy CONNECT request and requires that the proxy al-\r\n              lows direct connect to the remote port number curl wants to tun-\r\n              nel through to.\r\n\r\n              To  suppress  proxy CONNECT response headers when curl is set to\r\n              output headers use --suppress-connect-headers.\r\n\r\n              See also -x, --proxy.\r\n\r\n       --pubkey <key>\r\n              (SFTP SCP) Public key file name. Allows you to provide your pub-\r\n              lic key in this separate file.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n              (As of 7.39.0, curl attempts to automatically extract the public\r\n              key from the private key file, so passing this option is  gener-\r\n              ally not required. Note that this public key extraction requires\r\n              libcurl to be linked against a copy of libssh2 1.2.8  or  higher\r\n              that is itself linked against OpenSSL.)\r\n\r\n       -Q, --quote\r\n              (FTP  SFTP)  Send an arbitrary command to the remote FTP or SFTP\r\n              server. Quote commands are sent BEFORE the transfer takes  place\r\n              (just  after  the  initial PWD command in an FTP transfer, to be\r\n              exact). To make commands take place after a successful transfer,\r\n              prefix  them  with  a  dash '-'.  To make commands be sent after\r\n              curl has changed the working directory, just before the transfer\r\n              command(s),  prefix  the  command  with a '+' (this is only sup-\r\n              ported for FTP). You may specify any number of commands.\r\n\r\n              If the server returns failure for one of the commands,  the  en-\r\n              tire operation will be aborted. You must send syntactically cor-\r\n              rect FTP commands as RFC 959 defines to FTP servers, or  one  of\r\n              the commands listed below to SFTP servers.\r\n\r\n              Prefix  the  command  with an asterisk (*) to make curl continue\r\n              even if the command fails as by default curl will stop at  first\r\n              failure.\r\n\r\n              This option can be used multiple times.\r\n\r\n              SFTP  is a binary protocol. Unlike for FTP, curl interprets SFTP\r\n              quote commands itself before sending them to the  server.   File\r\n              names may be quoted shell-style to embed spaces or special char-\r\n              acters.  Following is the list of all supported SFTP quote  com-\r\n              mands:\r\n\r\n              chgrp group file\r\n                     The  chgrp command sets the group ID of the file named by\r\n                     the file operand to the group ID specified by  the  group\r\n                     operand.

When\r\n              used  with  -L,  --location  you  can  append \";auto\" to the -e,\r\n              --referer URL to make curl automatically set  the  previous  URL\r\n              when  it  follows  a Location: header. The \";auto\" string can be\r\n              used alone, even if you don't set an initial -e, --referer.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n              See also -A, --user-agent and -H, --header.\r\n\r\n       -J, --remote-header-name\r\n              (HTTP) This option tells the -O, --remote-name option to use the\r\n              server-specified  Content-Disposition  filename  instead  of ex-\r\n              tracting a filename from the URL.\r\n\r\n              If the server specifies a file name and a file  with  that  name\r\n              already  exists  in the current working directory it will not be\r\n              overwritten and an error will occur. If the server doesn't spec-\r\n              ify a file name then this option has no effect.\r\n\r\n              There's  no  attempt to decode %-sequences (yet) in the provided\r\n              file name, so this option may provide you with rather unexpected\r\n              file names.\r\n\r\n              WARNING:  Exercise  judicious  use of this option, especially on\r\n              Windows. A rogue server could send you the  name  of  a  DLL  or\r\n              other  file  that could possibly be loaded automatically by Win-\r\n              dows or some third party software.\r\n\r\n       --remote-name-all\r\n              This option changes the default action for all given URLs to  be\r\n              dealt with as if -O, --remote-name were used for each one. So if\r\n              you want to disable that for a specific URL after --remote-name-\r\n              all has been used, you must use \"-o -\" or --no-remote-name.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.19.0.\r\n\r\n       -O, --remote-name\r\n              Write  output to a local file named like the remote file we get.\r\n              (Only the file part of the remote file is used, the path is  cut\r\n              off.)\r\n\r\n              The  file will be saved in the current working directory. If you\r\n              want the file saved in a  different  directory,  make  sure  you\r\n              change  the  current working directory before invoking curl with\r\n              this option.\r\n\r\n              The remote file name to use for saving  is  extracted  from  the\r\n              given  URL,  nothing  else,  and if it already exists it will be\r\n              overwritten. If you want the server to be  able  to  choose  the\r\n              file name refer to -J, --remote-header-name which can be used in\r\n              addition to this option. If the server chooses a file  name  and\r\n              that name already exists it will not be overwritten.\r\n\r\n              There is no URL decoding done on the file name. If it has %20 or\r\n              other URL encoded parts of the name, they will end up  as-is  as\r\n              file name.\r\n\r\n              You  may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you\r\n              have.\r\n\r\n       -R, --remote-time\r\n              When used, this will make curl attempt to figure out  the  time-\r\n              stamp  of the remote file, and if that is available make the lo-\r\n              cal file get that same timestamp.\r\n\r\n       --request-target\r\n              (HTTP) Tells curl to use an alternative \"target\" (path)  instead\r\n              of  using  the  path as provided in the URL. Particularly useful\r\n              when wanting to issue HTTP requests  without  leading  slash  or\r\n              other  data  that  doesn't  follow the regular URL pattern, like\r\n              \"OPTIONS *\".\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.55.0.\r\n\r\n       -X, --request <command>\r\n              (HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when communicat-\r\n              ing  with the HTTP server.  The specified request method will be\r\n              used instead of the method otherwise  used  (which  defaults  to\r\n              GET).  Read  the HTTP 1.1 specification for details and explana-\r\n              tions. Common additional HTTP requests include PUT  and  DELETE,\r\n              but related technologies like WebDAV offers PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE\r\n              and more.\r\n\r\n              Normally you don't need this option. All  sorts  of  GET,  HEAD,\r\n              POST and PUT requests are rather invoked by using dedicated com-\r\n              mand line options.\r\n\r\n              This option only changes the actual word used in  the  HTTP  re-\r\n              quest, it does not alter the way curl behaves. So for example if\r\n              you want to make a proper HEAD request, using -X HEAD  will  not\r\n              suffice. You need to use the -I, --head option.\r\n\r\n              The  method  string  you set with -X, --request will be used for\r\n              all requests, which if you for example use  -L,  --location  may\r\n              cause  unintended  side-effects when curl doesn't change request\r\n              method according to the HTTP 30x response codes - and similar.\r\n\r\n              (FTP) Specifies a custom FTP command to use instead of LIST when\r\n              doing file lists with FTP.\r\n\r\n              (POP3) Specifies a custom POP3 command to use instead of LIST or\r\n              RETR. (Added in 7.26.0)\r\n\r\n              (IMAP) Specifies a custom IMAP command to use instead  of  LIST.\r\n              (Added in 7.30.0)\r\n\r\n              (SMTP) Specifies a custom SMTP command to use instead of HELP or\r\n              VRFY. (Added in 7.34.0)\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       --resolve <host:port:address[,address]...>\r\n              Provide a custom address for a specific host and port pair.  Us-\r\n              ing  this, you can make the curl requests(s) use a specified ad-\r\n              dress and prevent the otherwise normally resolved address to  be\r\n              used.  Consider  it a sort of /etc/hosts alternative provided on\r\n              the command line. The port number should be the number used  for\r\n              the  specific  protocol  the host will be used for. It means you\r\n              need several entries if you want to provide address for the same\r\n              host but different ports.\r\n\r\n              By  specifying '*' as host you can tell curl to resolve any host\r\n              and specific port pair to the specified address. Wildcard is re-\r\n              solved  last so any --resolve with a specific host and port will\r\n              be used first.\r\n\r\n              The provided address set by this option will be used even if -4,\r\n              --ipv4 or -6, --ipv6 is set to make curl use another IP version.\r\n              Support for providing the IP address within [brackets] was added\r\n              in 7.57.0.\r\n\r\n              Support for providing multiple IP addresses per entry was  added\r\n              in 7.59.0.\r\n\r\n              Support for resolving with wildcard was added in 7.64.0.\r\n\r\n              This option can be used many times to add many host names to re-\r\n              solve.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.21.3.\r\n\r\n       --retry-connrefused\r\n              In addition to the other conditions, consider ECONNREFUSED as  a\r\n              transient  error  too  for --retry. This option is used together\r\n              with --retry.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.52.0.\r\n\r\n       --retry-delay <seconds>\r\n              Make curl sleep this amount of time before  each  retry  when  a\r\n              transfer  has  failed with a transient error (it changes the de-\r\n              fault backoff time algorithm between retries).  This  option  is\r\n              only  interesting if --retry is also used. Setting this delay to\r\n              zero will make curl use the default backoff time.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.12.3.\r\n\r\n       --retry-max-time <seconds>\r\n              The retry timer is reset before the first transfer attempt.  Re-\r\n              tries  will  be done as usual (see --retry) as long as the timer\r\n              hasn't reached this given limit. Notice that if the timer hasn't\r\n              reached  the  limit, the request will be made and while perform-\r\n              ing, it may take longer than this given time period. To limit  a\r\n              single request's maximum time, use -m, --max-time.  Set this op-\r\n              tion to zero to not timeout retries.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.12.3.\r\n\r\n       --retry <num>\r\n              If a transient error is returned when curl tries  to  perform  a\r\n              transfer,  it  will retry this number of times before giving up.\r\n              Setting the number to 0 makes curl do no retries (which  is  the\r\n              default).  Transient  error  means either: a timeout, an FTP 4xx\r\n              response code or an HTTP 408 or 5xx response code.\r\n\r\n              When curl is about to retry a transfer, it will first  wait  one\r\n              second  and  then for all forthcoming retries it will double the\r\n              waiting time until it reaches 10 minutes which then will be  the\r\n              delay  between  the rest of the retries.  By using --retry-delay\r\n              you  disable  this  exponential  backoff  algorithm.  See   also\r\n              --retry-max-time to limit the total time allowed for retries.\r\n\r\n              Since  curl  7.66.0,  curl will comply with the Retry-After: re-\r\n              sponse header if one was present to know when to issue the  next\r\n              retry.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.12.3.\r\n\r\n       --sasl-authzid\r\n              Use this authorisation identity (authzid), during SASL PLAIN au-\r\n              thentication, in addition to the authentication identity  (auth-\r\n              cid) as specified by -u, --user.\r\n\r\n              If  the  option  isn't specified, the server will derive the au-\r\n              thzid from the authcid, but if specified, and depending  on  the\r\n              server  implementation,  it may be used to access another user's\r\n              inbox, that the user has been granted access  to,  or  a  shared\r\n              mailbox for example.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.66.0.\r\n\r\n       --sasl-ir\r\n              Enable initial response in SASL authentication.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.31.0.\r\n\r\n       --service-name <name>\r\n              This option allows you to change the service name for SPNEGO.\r\n\r\n              Examples:    --negotiate    --service-name   sockd   would   use\r\n              sockd/server-name.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.43.0.\r\n       -S, --show-error\r\n              When used with -s, --silent, it makes curl show an error message\r\n              if it fails.\r\n       -s, --silent\r\n              Silent  or  quiet  mode.

That means TLS version 1.0 or\r\n              higher\r\n\r\n              See also --http1.1 and --http2. -1, --tlsv1  requires  that  the\r\n              underlying  libcurl  was built to support TLS. This option over-\r\n              rides --tlsv1.1 and --tlsv1.2 and --tlsv1.3.\r\n\r\n       --tr-encoding\r\n              (HTTP) Request a compressed Transfer-Encoding response using one\r\n              of  the  algorithms curl supports, and uncompress the data while\r\n              receiving it.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.21.6.\r\n\r\n       --trace-ascii <file>\r\n              Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, in-\r\n              cluding  descriptive  information, to the given output file. Use\r\n              \"-\" as filename to have the output sent to stdout.\r\n\r\n              This is very similar to --trace, but leaves out the hex part and\r\n              only  shows  the ASCII part of the dump. It makes smaller output\r\n              that might be easier to read for untrained humans.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n              This option overrides --trace and -v, --verbose.\r\n\r\n       --trace-time\r\n              Prepends a time stamp to each trace or verbose  line  that  curl\r\n              displays.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.14.0.\r\n\r\n       --trace <file>\r\n              Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, in-\r\n              cluding descriptive information, to the given output  file.  Use\r\n              \"-\"  as  filename  to have the output sent to stdout. Use \"%\" as\r\n              filename to have the output sent to stderr.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n              This option overrides -v, --verbose and --trace-ascii.\r\n\r\n       --unix-socket <path>\r\n              (HTTP) Connect through this Unix domain socket, instead of using\r\n              the network.\r\n\r\n              Added in 7.40.0.\r\n\r\n       -T, --upload-file <file>\r\n              This  transfers  the  specified local file to the remote URL. If\r\n              there is no file part in the specified URL, curl will append the\r\n              local file name. NOTE that you must use a trailing / on the last\r\n              directory to really prove to Curl that there is no file name  or\r\n              curl will think that your last directory name is the remote file\r\n              name to use. That will most likely cause the upload operation to\r\n              fail. If this is used on an HTTP(S) server, the PUT command will\r\n              be used.\r\n\r\n              Use the file name \"-\" (a single dash) to use stdin instead of  a\r\n              given  file.   Alternately,  the file name \".\" (a single period)\r\n              may be specified instead of \"-\" to  use  stdin  in  non-blocking\r\n              mode  to  allow  reading  server output while stdin is being up-\r\n              loaded.\r\n\r\n              You can specify one -T, --upload-file for each URL on  the  com-\r\n              mand  line.  Each -T, --upload-file + URL pair specifies what to\r\n              upload and to where. curl also supports \"globbing\"  of  the  -T,\r\n              --upload-file  argument,  meaning  that  you can upload multiple\r\n              files to a single URL by using the same URL globbing style  sup-\r\n              ported in the URL, like this:\r\n\r\n               curl --upload-file \"{file1,file2}\" http://www.example.com\r\n\r\n              or even\r\n\r\n               curl -T \"img[1-1000].png\" ftp://ftp.example.com/upload/\r\n\r\n              When  uploading  to an SMTP server: the uploaded data is assumed\r\n              to be RFC 5322 formatted. It has to feature the necessary set of\r\n              headers  and  mail  body formatted correctly by the user as curl\r\n              will not transcode nor encode it further in any way.\r\n\r\n       --url <url>\r\n              Specify a URL to fetch. This option is  mostly  handy  when  you\r\n              want to specify URL(s) in a config file.\r\n\r\n              If  the given URL is missing a scheme name (such as \"http://\" or\r\n              \"ftp://\" etc) then curl will make a guess based on the host.  If\r\n              the  outermost  sub-domain  name  matches DICT, FTP, IMAP, LDAP,\r\n              POP3 or SMTP then that protocol will  be  used,  otherwise  HTTP\r\n              will be used. Since 7.45.0 guessing can be disabled by setting a\r\n              default protocol, see --proto-default for details.\r\n\r\n              This option may be used any number of times.  To  control  where\r\n              this  URL  is written, use the -o, --output or the -O, --remote-\r\n              name options.\r\n\r\n       -B, --use-ascii\r\n              (FTP LDAP) Enable ASCII transfer. For FTP, this can also be  en-\r\n              forced  by  using  a  URL  that ends with \";type=A\". This option\r\n              causes data sent to stdout to be in text mode for win32 systems.\r\n\r\n       -A, --user-agent <name>\r\n              (HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server.\r\n              To  encode blanks in the string, surround the string with single\r\n              quote marks. This header can also be set with the  -H,  --header\r\n              or the --proxy-header options.\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       -u, --user <user:password>\r\n              Specify the user name and password to use for server authentica-\r\n              tion. Overrides -n, --netrc and --netrc-optional.\r\n\r\n              If you simply specify the user name,  curl  will  prompt  for  a\r\n              password.\r\n\r\n              The  user  name  and  passwords are split up on the first colon,\r\n              which makes it impossible to use a colon in the user  name  with\r\n              this option. The password can, still.\r\n\r\n              On systems where it works, curl will hide the given option argu-\r\n              ment from process listings. This is not enough to  protect  cre-\r\n              dentials  from  possibly getting seen by other users on the same\r\n              system as they will still be visible for a brief  moment  before\r\n              cleared. Such sensitive data should be retrieved from a file in-\r\n              stead or similar and never used in clear text in a command line.\r\n              When using Kerberos V5 with a Windows based  server  you  should\r\n              include  the  Windows domain name in the user name, in order for\r\n              the server to successfully obtain  a  Kerberos  Ticket.  If  you\r\n              don't then the initial authentication handshake may fail.\r\n\r\n              When  using  NTLM,  the user name can be specified simply as the\r\n              user name, without the domain, if there is a single  domain  and\r\n              forest in your setup for example.\r\n\r\n              To  specify  the domain name use either Down-Level Logon Name or\r\n              UPN (User Principal Name) formats. For example, EXAMPLE\\user and\r\n              user@example.com respectively.\r\n\r\n              If  you  use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and perform Ker-\r\n              beros V5, Negotiate, NTLM or Digest authentication then you  can\r\n              tell  curl  to select the user name and password from your envi-\r\n              ronment by specifying a single colon with this option: \"-u :\".\r\n\r\n              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\r\n\r\n       -v, --verbose\r\n              Makes curl verbose during the operation.  Useful  for  debugging\r\n              and  seeing  what's  going  on \"under the hood\". A line starting\r\n              with '>' means \"header data\" sent by  curl,  '<'  means  \"header\r\n              data\"  received  by  curl  that is hidden in normal cases, and a\r\n              line starting with '*' means additional info provided by curl.\r\n\r\n              If you only want HTTP headers in the output, -i, --include might\r\n              be the option you're looking for.\r\n\r\n              If  you think this option still doesn't give you enough details,\r\n              consider using --trace or --trace-ascii instead.\r\n\r\n              Use -s, --silent to make curl really quiet.\r\n\r\n              See also  -i,  --include.
